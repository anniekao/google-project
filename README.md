# google-project
This project was completed as part of The Odin Project. The assignment was the recreate the frontpage of Google as a way to practice the HTML and CSS skills acquired up to that point in the course. It should be noted that since the assignment specifically said that it didn't need to be functional, neither the links nor the search bar work. I learned how to structure the website as well as how to place the top and bottom navigation bars using CSS. The search box was relatively straightforward to setup, but I had to figure out how to add the shadow to the box. The parts which I have yet to figure out are how to get the icons in the top navigation bar to align perfectly with the text elements and how to get the icons to look similar to those one the Google frontpage.
